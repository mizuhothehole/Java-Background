Java se 11 new features

1.var is added and can only be used in local varibles. Could not be used as field or as a parameter in any methods or will come out complile error.
2.java.lang do not need any import statetemts in java file. but java.lang.ref.* and any other sub pachages are needed to be added in to the import statements.
3.If you do not write the package import statement of a java class it will come out to be that a default package would be used with out any name.
4.Let me try some interesting things in 3 above:

public class NewClass {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Worldaaaaa!");
         System.out.print(new NewClass().getClass().getPackage().getName().length());
         System.out.print(System.lineSeparator());
         System.out.print(new Mavenproject1().getClass().getPackage().getName());
    }
}

this shows in console:

Hello Worldaaaaa!
0
com.se11silver.mavenproject1

So, well. the default can run main method, but could not even have a name. The outside any packages can not import classes defined in  default package.
Also, the default package could import any outside packages just if they are defined as public.

5. Another interesting feature:
The [for] word means a loop, how ever, the object must implement the [Iterable] interface in order to be looped.
for(A;B;C), Only the B part cannot be filled with any kind of[,], which means muptiple statement.

6.Also the StringBuilder created a 16 char sized capacity if it is newed by default.

    /**
     * Constructs a string builder with no characters in it and an
     * initial capacity of 16 characters.
     */
    @HotSpotIntrinsicCandidate
    public StringBuilder() {
        super(16);
    }
    
7.About the while.
while(A) {
B
};
The A part will always be executed once in any cases. This is a big trap if there is any value changed written in the A part.
