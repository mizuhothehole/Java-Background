I am in trouble because of the project would not be passed by any.
So I got the hole workplace from other people and just deploy the au app parts.
oh, I forgot I worked fot softbank about half a year and now work for AU, which is under the KDDI in japan.

Our team is in some trouble and I am trying to get the env fine by doing these efforts.

1.delete meta with bk
2.impt the auApp
3.build by eclipse
4.fix err
5.fix build.xml and run ant
6.deply if eclipse and ant fine

I think 3,4 would be hard working. However if I can think of that the au app can run just by itself, this would be a local test env.
But the env for reviewing would be another, as I thinkedã€‚
So what is the best solution here we have?
What is cvs? I have no any idea. But in this moment as I think about, is to work like unit test in local test env and do the commit by
cvs env. However if I could not finishi that, I would in some big trouble.

Well, I decide to give up the env and just do the usual works assigned to me from tomorrow.
So maybe I would not rest in the 12:00-13:00, and this is bad news.

Japanese IT, that is very hard. I think it is with the least attraction to young people.
