java garbage

An object is considered garbage when there are no longer any references to it stored
in any variables,
the fields of any objects,
or the elements of any arrays.

1）no variables in methods
2）no fields in objects
3）no array elements

1）method variable is in stack. no considering.

2）so when object reference no existing，the
field reference will also be collected.

3）array is object in java. Think it as 1）and 2）.

So we can judge them like above.
