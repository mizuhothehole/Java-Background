play framework

This is a JVM base web application fw.
It is based on scala and java. We can develop web projects on play-framework.
It is now also in the idea-intellij ide and we can create a scala project just using this.
Scala can be compiled into java, so we could be able to use JVM to do our works.
Also we could see the scala framework has the possibility to develop faster, it is also based on the MVC.
